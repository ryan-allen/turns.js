A little JavaScript library for writing turn based stories.

The goal is to make the library flexible enough to be able to run
on either the command line or in perhaps a webpage that looks pretty.

The other goal is to experiment with using javascript object literals
to write the stories, much like how my lumberjack library is written
in order to write object trees.

The other goal is for me to write some JavaScript in the style suggested
by Dougalas Crockford's book 'JavaScript - The Good Parts'. Which
is a great read, by the way.

So far it doesn't look right (the story markup), might have to write
some intermediate library for writing stories without the hectic
nested objects, ack.

To run the example story, you'll need spider monkey installed, (on
Ubuntu it's 'apt-get install spidermonkey-bin'), and then type:

  js play.js

To run through the Ice Cream Shop story.
